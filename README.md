# Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-a-Telecommunications-Company
Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company. The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify  customers at risk of churning, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain  them
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
You can use this dataset for the assignment: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telcocustomer-churn
Preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare it for 
analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform EDA on the dataset to understand customer behaviour and factors influencing churn.
Visualize key findings using appropriate graphs and charts.
Building the Churn Prediction Model:
Choose and implement a machine learning algorithms for churn prediction. You can consider 
algorithms like logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, or any other suitable 
models. Train and fine-tune the models using the dataset.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of your churn prediction modes using appropriate metrics like 
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
